# MRI-GNP: MRI-based Glioma Neuropathology Prediction Deep Learning System



**MRI-GNP (MRI-based Glioma Neuropathology Prediction)** is a state-of-the-art deep learning system designed for the non-invasive, preoperative prediction of neuropathological features in adult-type diffuse gliomas (ADGs) using standard MR images.

Developed using a massive dataset of **35,616 MR images from 8,844 patients across 22 datasets from three countries**, this system aims to enhance diagnostic precision and provide crucial support for clinical decision-making.

## Core Features

* **üß† Comprehensive Neuropathology Prediction**: Predicts 12 critical neuropathology markers preoperatively, covering key WHO grading criteria, molecular markers, and genetic alterations.
* **üìÑ Virtual Pathology Reports**: Integrates model outputs into intuitive "virtual pathology reports," which have been validated to significantly improve the diagnostic accuracy of neuroradiologists.
* **üß© Robustness to Missing Data**: Incorporates generative models to address the common clinical challenge of missing contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging sequences, enhancing the system's real-world applicability.
* **üåç High Generalizability**: Built on a large-scale, multi-center, and international dataset to ensure the model is robust and generalizable across diverse clinical settings.

## Model Performance

MRI-GNP demonstrates strong and reliable performance across several key prediction tasks. Performance was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).

| Prediction Task | Performance Level | AUC Score |
| :--- | :---: | :---: |
| **High WHO Grade** | **High** | **0.852** |
| **IDH Mutation** | **High** | **0.826** |
| **1p/19q Codeletion** | **High** | **0.823** |
| **Ki-67 Expression** | **High** | **0.817** |
| WHO Grade 2/3/4 | Moderate | ‚â• 0.7 |
| +7/-10 Alteration | Moderate | ‚â• 0.7 |
| CDKN2A/B Homozygous Deletion | Moderate | ‚â• 0.7 |
| TERT Promoter Mutation | Moderate | ‚â• 0.7 |
| EGFR Amplification | Moderate | ‚â• 0.7 |
| MGMT Promoter Methylation | Poor | ‚Äî |
| TP53 Mutation | Poor | ‚Äî |
| ATRX Mutation | Poor | ‚Äî |

## Technical Architecture

After comprehensive evaluation of various deep learning architectures, input formats, and training strategies, the optimal configuration was identified as a **Pretrained Vision Transformer (ViT)** with a **2.5D input configuration**. This approach allows the model to efficiently capture spatial and contextual features from multi-sequence MRI scans.

## Clinical Significance

MRI-GNP is a powerful tool with strong potential to enhance patient care by:
* **Enhancing Precision Diagnostics**: Providing crucial molecular and genetic information non-invasively before surgery, enabling more accurate diagnosis and tumor classification.
* **Guiding Treatment Planning**: Assisting clinicians in tailoring personalized treatment strategies, including surgical extent, radiation, and chemotherapy regimens.
* **Supporting Clinical Decision-Making**: Empowering clinical teams with reliable, data-driven insights to support complex decision-making processes and improve patient outcomes.
