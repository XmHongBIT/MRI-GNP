MRI-GNP: An MRI-Based Deep Learning System for Noninvasive Neuropathological Profiling of Adult-Type Diffuse Glioma
MRI-GNP (MRI-based Glioma Neuropathology Prediction) is a state-of-the-art deep learning system designed for the noninvasive, preoperative prediction of neuropathological features in adult-type diffuse gliomas (ADGs) using standard MRI scans. This system provides critical diagnostic information to neurosurgeons and neuro-oncologists, aiding in personalized treatment planning.

Largest Multi-Center Study: This project is built on and validated with data from the largest multi-center study to date, comprising 35,616 MRI images and 39,642 neuropathology markers from 8,844 patients across 32 international centers.
