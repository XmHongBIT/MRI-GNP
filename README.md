MRI-GNP: An MRI-Based Deep Learning System for Noninvasive Neuropathological Profiling of Adult-Type Diffuse Glioma
MRI-GNP (MRI-based Glioma Neuropathology Prediction) is a state-of-the-art deep learning system designed for the noninvasive, preoperative prediction of neuropathological features in adult-type diffuse gliomas (ADGs) using standard MRI scans. This system provides critical diagnostic information to neurosurgeons and neuro-oncologists, aiding in personalized treatment planning.

Key Highlights
Largest Multi-Center Study: This project is built on and validated with data from the largest multi-center study to date, comprising 35,616 MRI images and 39,642 neuropathology markers from 8,844 patients across 32 international centers.

High Predictive Performance: The system achieves high predictive accuracy (AUC â‰¥ 0.8) for clinically essential markers, including WHO high grade, IDH mutation, and 1p/19q codeletion.

Clinical Utility: MRI-GNP generates virtual pathology reports that significantly improve the diagnostic accuracy of neuroradiologists, demonstrating the system's strong potential for clinical integration.

Robustness to Missing Data: We integrated generative models into the system, allowing for reliable predictions even when crucial T1CE sequences are unavailable by synthesizing the missing images.
